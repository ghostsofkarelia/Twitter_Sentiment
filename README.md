## Synopsis

This is a JavaScript port of my python sentiment analysis project.

This application conducts sentiment analysis on tweets obtained from twitter's public search API. Sentiment analysis determining the "attitude" of tweets (how "positive" or "negative") about a particular topic.
The analysis is carried out using AFINN data which is a list of words that have been manually labelled an integer rating between minus 5 (negative) and plus 5 (positive). This sentiment is then used along 
with the popularity of each tweet to generate a pearson coefficient that shows the correlation between sentiment and number of times retweeted.
